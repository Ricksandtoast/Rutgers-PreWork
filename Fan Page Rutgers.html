        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            The Dillinger Escape Plan was an American mathcore band from Morris Plains, New Jersey, formed in 1997; it was named after bank robber John Dillinger. The band's final line-up – which consisted of founding lead guitarist Ben Weinman, bassist Liam Wilson, vocalist Greg Puciato, drummer Billy Rymer, and rhythm guitarist Kevin Antreassian – toured for the last time and disbanded at the end of 2017.

            The Dillinger Escape Plan evolved from the hardcore punk band Arcane around 1997. They were an aggressive, political-oriented act formed in 1996 by Ben Weinman on guitar, Chris Pennie on drums, Dimitri Minakakis on vocals, Bruce Fulton on bass and Brad McMann on second vocals. Arcane played for a few months but eventually disbanded because they "were kinda sick of trying to become part of a clique and to write music that would fit into a theme", said Weinman. Thereafter, they turned around their sound and aesthetic, with Pennie's friend Adam Doll replacing McMann and Derek Brantley taking the place of Fulton.[2]

            They quickly, without much thought, chose the name “The Dillinger Escape Plan” while watching a documentary on the John Dillinger, a early 1930s bank robber, famous for his multiple escapes from jail. Brantley didn't show up when the band was recording the 6 song self titled effort with producer Steve Evetts causing the band to record as a quartet.
